# Text-based-RPG

## Overview

**LEGACY OF YHARNAM SHADOWS OF THE FORGOTTEN** is a text-based RPG adventure written in C.  
You play as a chosen hero on a quest to gather ancient relics, solve puzzles, and defeat powerful foesâ€”including the Dark Lord himself.  
The game features branching paths, humorous encounters, turn-based combat, and a classic fantasy storyline.

## Features

- Explore forests, dungeons, and castles
- Solve riddles and puzzles
- Engage in turn-based battles with monsters and bosses
- Collect relics and powerful items
- Make choices that affect your journey

## How to Compile

1. **Ensure you have a C compiler installed** (e.g., `gcc` on macOS/Linux or `MinGW` on Windows).
2. **Open a terminal in the project directory.**

### Using the Makefile (Recommended)

If a `Makefile` is provided, simply run:

```sh
make
```

This will build the game and create an executable named `text_rpg` (or as specified in your Makefile).

### Manual Compilation

If you prefer to compile manually, you can run:

```sh
gcc src/*.c -o text_rpg
```

Or, if you want to specify files individually:

```sh
gcc src/main.c src/player.c src/exploration.c src/quests.c src/combat.c src/common.c src/save.c -o text_rpg
```

3. **Run the game:**

   ```sh
   ./text_rpg
   ```

## Notes

- The game is played entirely in the terminal/command prompt.
- Follow on-screen instructions for controls and choices.
- Save/load features may require the game to be run from the same directory.

## Enjoy your adventure!
